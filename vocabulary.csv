rock-n-roll:GeologicConcept,Geologic Concept,,"A subset of the Universe of all concepts, which includes only those concepts related to: ""The study of the planet Earth--the materials of which it is made, the processes that act on these materials, the products formed, and the history of the planet and its life forms since its origin."" [Jackson, 1997; p. 265] This conceptual model is focused primarily on geologic concepts that can be represented on geologic maps and diagrams. The term concept represents the notion of any mental phenomena that human beings use in their internal representation of the world. Webster’s dictionary [1996] uses the terms ‘idea’ and ‘object of thought’ to convey the meaning of ‘concept.’ GeologicConcepts identify the kinds of observable or inferred phenomena that earth scientists recognize."
